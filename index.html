        Title: Have you ever thought?<br>
        Have you ever thought of noticing someone?<br>
        Have you ever thought of checking on them?<br>
        Your interactions aren't a ton,<br>
        But they still love you,<br>
        Between you two,<br>
        Bond doesn't stem,<br>
        Although you're busy,<br>
        They still care,<br>
        They wish you could see,<br>
        The silence they'd tear.

        Title: The Woman<br>
        The woman walked freely,<br>
        Her eyes glimmered with grace,<br>
        The woman was lovely,<br>
        Her presence made hearts race,<br>
        The woman always smiled,<br>
        You could see it wide from a mile,<br>
        The woman was a kind soul,<br>
        To lighten the world was her goal,<br>
        The woman loved and loved,<br>
        She gave herself away,<br>
        It felt like being harshly shoved,<br>
        Because now she can't stay.

    <h3>
        1/3/26<br>
        Just Maybe:<br>
        Maybe, just maybe, if I gave you a chance,<br>
        Maybe, just maybe, if I gave you a glance,<br>
        I should've known—<br>
        I was cold and heartless,<br>
        To do such a thing,<br>
        You're not something I own,<br>
        I was just careless,<br>
        Now that you're gone,<br>
        I build walls to cling,<br>
        Because my comfort has been withdrawn.
    </h3>

        12/24/25<br>
        Flower:<br>
        At first, you were the best thing ever,<br>
        You were someone I couldn't let go,<br>
        It felt like us forever,<br>
        You were like a fresh flowe
